<!-- !-- - A beautiful landscape picture's URL
- Prata font from fonts.google.com
- Montserrat font in 400 and 600 italic weights from fonts.google.com

- Reset the margins on the body tag
- Import your fonts in the head tag
- Create container div for your main section and give it a class of “main-section” and style it with 20px padding all around
- Create a div inside and give it a class of image-container
- Style image-container to be 500px tall and add the landscape picture as its background (make sure it doesn't get distorted and that it covers the image-container area fully and proportionally).
- Add an h1 below the image with the name of the place in the image.
- Style it to be in Prata font, with a size of 64px and a weight of 400
- Add an h3 below it with the location or region name, apply the same font, 24px size and weight 400
- Find a way to place h1 and h3 side by side on the same line and give both margin bottom of 0
- Apply Montserrat as your body font

- Add a paragraph below with the author of the picture (eg. Author: Name Surname)
- Wrap name and surname of the author in a link tag with the address of their profile page
- Style the link to be in a 600 weight and italic style
- Add an h6 tag with the text: “Related places”

- Style the h6 to have padding 22px all around, 0px bottom margin, 56px top margin, white color for the text, rounded borders for 6px, and a horizontal gradient as a background. Pick two colors from the image to use as the gradient color steps.
- Create an unordered list below the h6 with 5 items in it, each one having names of related places
- Style the unordered list to remove the dots and default left padding
- Wrap each list item in a link tag. Use as address something like this: “./name-of-place.html”
- Style each list item to have 6px padding top and bottom, 22px padding-left, 1px border bottom with this color: #dfdfdf
- Remove the underline from the inner links of the list items and change the color to the one you used as the first color step of the previous gradient.
- Now duplicate your index.html as many times as you need and give them the same name you used in the links before (eg. name-of-place.html)
- Update the information, image, h6 background gradient and links color in each page to represent the corresponding place
- Add a footer outside of the main section, color it in black and make sure the text is white. Add 16px padding all around (If you did everything correctly it should be attached to the window borders: left, bottom and right)
- Add a link the homepage: “./index.html” and center it
- Now you should be able to navigate through each and every page and come back to the homepage. -->
